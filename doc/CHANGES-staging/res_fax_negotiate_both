Added configuration option "negotiate_both". This option is only used
when a gateway is enabled, and a v21 preamble is detected. If this option
is enabled, once a preamble is detected Asterisk will initiate negotiation
requests to both T.38 enabled endpoint versus waiting, and forwarding a
request from an initiating endpoint. Defaults to disabled.
